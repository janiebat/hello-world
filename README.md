# hello-world
first github repository
Hello!
This is my first venture into Github! I am trying to learn new data science skills while I am taking time out of my career to care for my toddler son and new baby. Things I love: afternoon nap time (his not mine), chocomelts, ticking things off my list. Things I hate: starting conversations with new people, irrational toddler tantrums, getting woken up in the middle of the night.
